# Squishy

<p>
Squishy is a lightweight library that lets developers control the overscroll effect of the parent container/child composables based on user input. The library exposes all the necessary parameters for developers to control the behavior. Here is the prototype of the scroll/fling behavior in relation to overscroll.
